# Google Books Search 


## Description
In this repository you will find a React-based Google Books Search app. Users are able to search for a book by title or author, and the results are dynamically-displayed on the page using a React component. Each result features the book's:
* Title
* Author(s)
* Description
* Image
* Link to more information
* Save button

If the user decides to save a book, the "Save" button changes to "Saved!", alerting the user that an action has been taken. Saved books can be viewed or deleted in the digital library, which can be accessed via a link in the navbar.
